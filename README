migrate is a plugin for migrating the content of one
[TiddlyWeb](http://tiddlyweb.com) store to another. This can
provide two functions:

* Duplicating a store to the same format for use elsewhere, or backups.
* Changing the format of the store from one StorageInterface
  implementation to another (e.g. from text to sqlalchemy3).

To use 'migrate' the `tiddlywebconfig.py` in the source
instance should be edited to add `tiddlywebplugins.migrate` to
`twanager_plugins` and to add a `target_store` key.

The `target_store` key's value is the same form as `server_store`,
and contains the config information of the store being migrated to.

Here's an example that will migrate from the
[sqlalchemy3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tiddlywebplugins.sqlalchemy3)
store to the text store, with the data stored in a dir in `/tmp`:

```
config = {
    'twanager_plugins': ['tiddlywebplugins.migrate'],
    'server_store': ['tiddlywebplugins.sqlalchemy3', {
        'db_config': 'sqlite:///test.db'}],
    'target_store': ['text', {'store_root': '/tmp/backupstore'}],
}
```

Once the configuration is set the `twanager` command is run:

```
twanager migrate
```

If the store is large this may take some time.

When tiddlers are migrated from one store to another, they
are stored as new revisions, so if the target store already
exists and has a tiddler of the same name in the same bag,
it will and a new revision to the existing tiddler.
